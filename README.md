### Project Description[Study Fam is a personalized self-study web app that allows users to create topics and subtopics, track their focus with timed study sessions, and rate their performance. Based on user ratings, it suggests re-sessions or breaks to optimize learning. It also stores progress and ratings in the cloud for easy tracking.

### The Problem statement
Many students struggle to stay focused and track their study progress effectively. Study Fam helps solve this by providing structured sessions, progress tracking, and personalized suggestions based on performance.

### The Solution
Study Fam solves the problem of poor focus and ineffective study tracking by providing a structured and interactive self-study platform. Users can create topics and subtopics to organize their learning, set timed study sessions, and rate their focus after each session. Based on these ratings, the system gives personalized suggestions—such as redoing a session with a shorter time if the focus was low, or taking a break if the user performed well. All progress and ratings are stored in the cloud, allowing users to monitor improvement over time. By combining time management, self-assessment, and actionable feedback, Study Fam helps students stay motivated, focused, and organized in their learning.
